## Relationships

- A **Tracked Repository** has zero or more **Tracked Workflows**
- A **Workflow Match Rule** selects zero or more **Tracked Workflows**
- **Workflow Match Rules** support workflow file basenames such as `ci.yml` and may scope matches by workflow ref
- Workflow names and full workflow paths are not supported in **Workflow Match Rules**
- A workflow run belongs to at most one **Tracked Workflow**, using workflow file basename and workflow ref matching
- A **Workflow Match Rule** without a ref matches all workflow refs
- Workflow ref matching supports exact refs and glob patterns such as `release/*`; regex is not supported
- When multiple rules can match the same run, precedence is exact ref, then glob ref, then file-only
- Multiple same-precedence rules matching the same run are invalid configuration
- **Workflow File Path** is parsed from workflow run metadata without guessing from workflow name
- Workflow file basename is parsed from the path segment before `@`; workflow ref is parsed from the segment after `@`
- **Workflow Ref Unavailable** runs can match file-only rules but cannot match ref-specific rules, and are grouped under an explicit unknown ref bucket
- Run storage keeps structured `workflow_file`, optional `workflow_ref`, and optional raw `workflow_path` fields
- Tracked workflow statistics are grouped by both `workflow_file` and `workflow_ref`
- **Workflow File Unavailable** runs keep **Workflow Run Metadata** but do not become **Tracked Workflows** and do not trigger job collection

- **Repository Configuration Validation** must fail invalid repository entries, missing workflow rules, non-file workflow rules, duplicate rules, and GitHub workflow files that cannot be found during online CI validation
- **Repository Configuration Validation** may call GitHub workflows APIs to validate workflow file existence, but daily collection does not call those APIs for matching
- **Repository Configuration Validation** validates workflow ref syntax and overlapping rule precedence, but it does not require refs to exist before matching historical or future runs
- All workflows selected by **Workflow Match Rules** are included in workflow and job statistics regardless of whether they are triggered by pull requests, schedules, manual dispatch, or other events
- A **Tracked Workflow** produces zero or more **Tracked Jobs**

- **Workflow Details Backfill** fills jobs and eligible steps for newly tracked historical workflow attempts within the retention window
- **Step Eligibility Backfill** fills historical eligible steps after threshold or workflow policy changes
- **Step Eligibility Backfill** is limited to the current retention window and bounded by a per-run API budget

## Example Dialogue

> **Dev:** "Do job p50 and p90 cover every job in the repository?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Job statistics only cover **Tracked Jobs** from configured **Tracked Workflows**."
>
> **Dev:** "Can workflow configuration use workflow names like `CI`?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Workflow Match Rules** support workflow file basenames and optional workflow refs."
>
> **Dev:** "If config only says `file: ci.yml`, does it match just `main`?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. It matches all refs, while statistics remain grouped by the actual workflow ref."
>
> **Dev:** "Can workflow ref config use regular expressions?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Use exact refs or simple glob patterns such as `release/*`."
>
> **Dev:** "If `file: ci.yml` and `file: ci.yml, ref: main` both match a run, do we count it twice?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The exact-ref rule wins; same-precedence overlap is invalid configuration."
>
> **Dev:** "If a workflow run has no usable `path`, do we infer the file from the workflow name?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Keep the run metadata, skip detailed collection, and surface a **Workflow File Unavailable** warning."
>
> **Dev:** "Do we delete old jobs and steps collected before tracked workflow filtering?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Retain them, but exclude details that do not match current **Workflow Match Rules** from tracked statistics."
>
> **Dev:** "If a PR triggers five workflows and only two are configured, do PR metrics show all five?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. PR metrics show only the configured workflows as **Tracked PR CI**."
>
> **Dev:** "Do we call the jobs API for every workflow run?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. We collect **Workflow Run Metadata** for every workflow run, but **Workflow Details** only for **Tracked Workflows**."
>
> **Dev:** "Do untracked workflows keep only a run ID?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Untracked workflows keep complete run-level metadata, but have no **Workflow Details**."
>
> **Dev:** "Does workflow runtime include time before GitHub starts executing the workflow?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Workflow Runtime** starts when the workflow run starts executing and ends when the workflow run finishes."
>
> **Dev:** "Should slow-workflow step analysis include workflows that are slow because they queued for a long time?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. The eligibility threshold uses **Workflow Total Duration**, but the report must separate queue delay from runtime work."
>
> **Dev:** "Does job total duration follow the same queue plus runtime model?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. **Job Total Duration** equals **Job Queue Duration** plus **Job Runtime**."
>
> **Dev:** "Do failed workflows contribute step data to optimization analysis?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Step Runtime Analysis** uses only **Slow Successful Workflows**."
>
> **Dev:** "If the jobs API returns steps for a fast or failed workflow, do we store them?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Only **Eligible Step Data** is persisted and used."
>
> **Dev:** "Do steps have queue or total duration metrics?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Step analysis uses **Step Runtime** only."
>
> **Dev:** "If a threshold change makes older workflow attempts step-eligible, do we leave them missing?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Step Eligibility Backfill** should collect those historical steps automatically."
>
> **Dev:** "Does automatic step backfill fetch every historical eligible attempt in one run?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. It is limited to the retention window, bounded by per-run API budget, and exposes pending backfill counts."
>
> **Dev:** "If a PR triggers the same tracked workflow three times, do we show only the latest run?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Show total workflow time, attempt count, success count, failure count, and per-attempt timing analysis."
>
> **Dev:** "Does PR success mean every historical attempt succeeded?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **PR Current CI Success** uses the latest terminal attempt per tracked workflow file and ref; **PR Attempt Success Rate** summarizes all attempts."
>
> **Dev:** "If a configured workflow never ran for a PR, is the PR CI incomplete?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. PR current success only evaluates tracked workflows that actually appear on that PR."
>
> **Dev:** "Do PRs with no tracked CI count against repository PR success rate?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. They are excluded from PR CI metrics and counted separately as **PRs Without Tracked CI**."
>
> **Dev:** "If GitHub reruns the same workflow run, does it replace the earlier attempt?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Each `run_attempt` is a separate **Workflow Attempt**."
>
> **Dev:** "Do queued or in-progress workflow attempts affect success rates or duration metrics?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. They are retained for visibility, but formal metrics use **Terminal Workflow Attempts**."
>
> **Dev:** "Should rerun attempts be stored by changing the runs table primary key?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Keep run metadata stable by `run_id` and store execution attempts in separate **Workflow Attempt Records**."
>
> **Dev:** "If steps were discarded before a threshold change, can backfill recover them without another jobs API call?"
> **Domain expert:** "No, unless raw job payloads were retained. Attempt-level fetch and policy state determines whether to re-fetch."
>
> **Dev:** "Should we store every raw jobs payload just in case step thresholds change later?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Do budgeted jobs API backfill instead of growing long-term storage."
>
> **Dev:** "Does every rerun attempt need its own PR resolution?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. PR association belongs to the run metadata and attempts inherit it through `run_id`."
>
> **Dev:** "Should PR workflow links point to the run or each attempt?"
> **Domain expert:** "Each attempt. Otherwise reruns are collapsed and PR execution counts become wrong."
>
> **Dev:** "Is GitHub `job_id` alone the job identity?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Job execution identity includes `run_id`, `run_attempt`, and `job_id`."
>
> **Dev:** "Can steps still be keyed only by `job_id` and step number?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Step execution identity includes `run_id`, `run_attempt`, `job_id`, and step number."
>
> **Dev:** "Why does total CI time exceed the time a developer waited?"
> **Domain expert:** "Because **Total Workflow Time** sums all workflow attempts, while **PR CI Wall Time** measures the elapsed span."
>
> **Dev:** "Should queue/runtime breakdown show only raw time?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Show raw time and percentage of **Total Workflow Time** so users can tell whether the bottleneck is queueing or execution."
>
> **Dev:** "Do failed workflow attempts disappear from PR total time?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. PR total time metrics include all terminal tracked attempts and show the conclusion breakdown."
>
> **Dev:** "If a PR still has running CI, does that change PR CI Wall Time every second?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Running CI is shown as **Current CI Elapsed Time**; **PR CI Wall Time** is based on terminal attempts."
>
> **Dev:** "Does running CI change Total Runtime every second?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Running execution is shown as **Current Runtime**, separate from terminal **Total Runtime**."
>
> **Dev:** "Can the PR page merge all refs for the same workflow file?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes, as a clearly labeled cross-ref summary; the default view remains grouped by workflow file and ref."
>
> **Dev:** "Does workflow success rate divide success by every run?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The denominator is terminal attempts excluding skipped and neutral runs, and the UI must explain that."
>
> **Dev:** "Does job success rate use a different denominator from workflow success rate?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Job Success Rate** uses the same terminal-outcome denominator semantics."
>
> **Dev:** "Do failed or cancelled runs affect workflow P90 duration?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Default P50/P90 duration metrics are **Successful Duration Percentiles**; non-success durations are analyzed separately."
>
> **Dev:** "Are job and step P50/P90 also successful-only?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. Default workflow, job, and step percentiles use successful samples only."
>
> **Dev:** "Can skipped or failed steps inside a successful workflow affect step P90?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Default step percentiles include only successful steps from successful tracked workflow attempts."
>
> **Dev:** "Can a successful job inside a failed workflow affect default job P90?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Default job percentiles include only successful jobs from successful tracked workflow attempts."
>
> **Dev:** "Is workflow P90 only runtime?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Workflow percentiles include total duration, queue duration, and runtime; total duration is the primary user-facing metric."
>
> **Dev:** "Does workflow queue P90 use failed or cancelled attempts?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Workflow total, queue, and runtime percentiles use successful tracked workflow attempts only."
>
> **Dev:** "Can step-level non-success analysis explain every failed workflow?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Step-level non-success analysis is best-effort because failed workflow steps are not fully persisted."
>
> **Dev:** "Do job percentiles include job total duration?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. Job percentiles include total duration, queue duration, and runtime; total duration is the primary metric."
>
> **Dev:** "If a repository is listed but has no configured workflows, should it still appear in statistics?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. A repository must specify workflow match rules to be included in statistics."
>
> **Dev:** "Should collection fail if a configured workflow has no matching runs?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Continue collection, but surface a **Missing Tracked Workflow** warning."
>
> **Dev:** "Can a repo config change merge before checking that the workflows exist?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Repository Configuration Validation** must run in CI for config changes."
>
> **Dev:** "Can config validation use extra GitHub workflow metadata calls?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. Validation may use GitHub workflows APIs, but daily collection should not."
>
> **Dev:** "Does every workflow use the same slow-step threshold?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Step Analysis Threshold** uses exact-ref workflow overrides first, then glob-ref workflow overrides, file-only workflow overrides, repository overrides, and defaults."
>
> **Dev:** "Can the same run count under two configured workflows?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. A run belongs to one **Tracked Workflow** at most, matched by workflow file basename and workflow ref."

## Flagged Ambiguities

- "All jobs" was used ambiguously. Resolved: job statistics mean all jobs under configured **Tracked Workflows**, not every GitHub Actions job in the repository.
- "Workflow name" can be duplicated or renamed without changing the workflow file. Resolved: **Workflow Match Rules** match workflow file basename only.
- "PR CI" could mean all workflows triggered by a pull request or only the configured analysis scope. Resolved: user-facing PR metrics use **Tracked PR CI**.
